<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>There isn't much to say about me, I'm a boy born in '92 who many would define as boring and "nerdy".
I am passionate about technology, video games and photography.
I obtained a degree in Cultural Heritage at the University of Salerno in 2019 and then made a radical change to my life the following year, approaching the tech world in the workplace for the first time.</p>

<p>I currently work in the field of technical assistance where I sometimes also approach databases; at the same time I study IT at an online university so I can afford my studies, so yes, I am a working student!
I'm recently approaching the world of Web programming and I'm very excited to have embarked on this path.</p>
